# Downloads and Streaming

Sonata supports both permanent downloads and on-demand streaming—giving users the choice between true ownership and convenient access.

## Overview

This page explains the two access models available on Sonata: encrypted downloads that you own forever, and validator-signed streaming for instant playback.

## Downloads: Own Your Music

Downloaded content on Sonata follows the GOG model—DRM-free ownership. When you purchase a track:

1. The encrypted file is downloaded to your device
2. Your wallet proves ownership to a validator
3. The validator returns a decryption key
4. You decrypt and own the file permanently

This is true ownership. Like GOG and unlike Steam, once decrypted, the file is yours. No platform dependency, no expiring licenses, no "you don't own this anymore" surprises. Your music works offline, across devices, forever.

## Streaming: Spotify-Like Access

For users who prefer not to manage downloads, Sonata offers verifiable streaming:

1. Your wallet proves ownership (or access rights for public content) to a validator
2. Instead of returning a decryption key, the validator returns an **expiring signed stream URL**
3. Powered by [gocloud.dev](https://gocloud.dev), these URLs provide time-limited access to the audio stream
4. Playback works seamlessly in any Sonata-compatible client

This gives you Spotify-like convenience with on-chain verification. No downloads to manage, instant playback, but still cryptographically verified access—not platform trust.

## Best of Both Worlds

| Model | Analogy | Ownership | Convenience |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Downloads | GOG | Full—you own the decrypted file | Requires storage, works offline |
| Streaming | Spotify | Verified access—no permanent file | Instant, no storage needed |

Users can choose based on their preferences. Collectors and archivists can download and own. Casual listeners can stream. Both models use the same validator verification flow—the only difference is what gets returned.
