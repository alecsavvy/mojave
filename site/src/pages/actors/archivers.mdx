# Archivers

Content in Mojave is replicated and seeded by bittorrent clients. The files are encrypted by OpenTDF and can only be accessed by actors with a valid DEK. This means that encrypted content can be securely replicated by anyone regardless of their location or infrastructure. Archivers are a type of actor that runs validator and/or bittorrent clients with the sole purpose of replicating and seeding content. This is to backup content validators may have lost or are unable to access.
