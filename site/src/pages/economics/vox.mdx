# Vox

VOX is the native token of Mojave. It is used as a utility and accounting mechanism for the protocol.

## VOX Flows

### Validator Rewards

Validators are rewarded for securing ERNs, replicating files, and providing wrapped DEKs to actors. They are rewarded with VOX each block. The amount of VOX rewarded is determined by the parameters of the network and what was required in the transactions.

### User Purchases Release with FIAT Funds

User has FIAT funds in some fashion. Artist has uploaded an ERN to the chain with a deallist and receiver who can attest to usage, in this case a purchase. Artist sets up a storefront with their own payment processor. User purchases release through the artist storefront. The artist's storefront creates an EntitlementAttestation transaction for the user. Once signed, sent, and confirmed by the network, the user is entitled to the release. This user is now entitled to this release even if the artist's storefront is offline or closes down. 

### User Purchases Release with VOX Funds

User has VOX funds in some fashion. Artist has uploaded an ERN to the chain with a deallist and receiver who can attest to usage, in this case a purchase. The artist deploys a composition which allows atomic transfers of VOX for a purchase. The user sends a transaction to this ERN requesting access. During finalization of the block, the composition will transfer the VOX from the user to the artist and also mint access to the release for the user. The user has now purchased and is entitled to this release without the artist needing to set up a storefront or payment processor.

### Transfers

VOX like any token can be transferred between actors in the network. This is a simple transfer of the token from one address to another. Exchange and payment rails can be built on top of this transfer mechanism so validators can pay for their infrastructure costs or users can pay for their content.
