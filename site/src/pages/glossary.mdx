## DDEX
**[Digital Data Exchange](https://ddex.net/)**

DDEX is a set of industry-standard specifications used by the global music industry to exchange metadata about recordings, releases, rights, and usage.

In Mojave, DDEX standards (such as ERN and PIE) provide a shared, interoperable language for describing music and ownership, allowing distributors, platforms, and rights holders to integrate without bespoke agreements.

## OpenTDF
**[Open Trusted Data Format](https://opentdf.io/)**

OpenTDF is an open standard for encrypting files and controlling access to them through policy rather than location.

Mojave uses OpenTDF so audio (and related assets) can be encrypted by default, with access granted or revoked through cryptographic keys and protocol rules—rather than relying on centralized storage permissions.

## CometBFT
**[Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus engine](https://cometbft.com/)**

CometBFT is a high-performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus engine derived from Tendermint. It allows a distributed set of validators to agree on shared state without trusting a single operator.

Mojave uses CometBFT as its consensus and settlement layer, providing deterministic finality, validator governance, and a verifiable ledger of distribution and access events.

## BitTorrent
**[Peer-to-peer content distribution protocol](https://www.bittorrent.com/)**

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol for distributing large files efficiently by sharing bandwidth across many participants rather than relying on a central server.

In Mojave, BitTorrent is used as a distribution mechanism (availability and delivery). The trust and access-control layer comes from encryption + protocol rules.
