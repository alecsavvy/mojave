# One Pager

**Mojave is shared infrastructure for audio distribution, replacing opaque industry pipelines with verifiable, software-enforced delivery and access.**

## Overview

Mojave is an economically self-sustaining infrastructure for open and equitable audio distribution. It provides the underlying rails that allow music to be delivered, accessed, and accounted for without centralized intermediaries.

Mojave is not a streaming app or a record label. It is the shared infrastructure layer that distributors, platforms, and rights holders can build on. Mojave is to Spotify what S3 is to Dropbox.

## Problem

Today’s music distribution stack is:

- operationally expensive  
- financially opaque  
- heavily reliant on individual B2B relationships  

This creates a system where:

- cost scales with bureaucracy  
- trust is brittle and difficult to verify  
- adaptation is slow and innovation is constrained  

Mojave replaces this system with infrastructure that enforces rules through software rather than people. This approach lowers costs and increases transparency across the entire distribution ecosystem.

## Intended Users

Mojave is built for organizations and individuals that distribute, manage, or consume music at scale and need infrastructure that is transparent and financially predictable.

- **Independent labels and distributors** seeking an alternative to opaque, revenue-share-based pipelines  
- **Artists and rights holders** who want direct distribution that is secure and enforceable  
- **Platforms and developers** building streaming, social, and analytics services on top of music  

## Architecture

Mojave combines battle-tested industry standards with modern distributed technologies to create a neutral and verifiable audio distribution layer.

- **DDEX** standards for metadata  
- **OpenTDF** for file encryption and access control  
- **CometBFT** for consensus, validation, and transaction processing  
- **BitTorrent** for encrypted and replicated file distribution  

The network is supported by small, transparent protocol fees tied to content delivery and access rather than negotiated revenue shares. Fees reflect the underlying cost of operating the network, including metadata validation, encrypted storage, and access control. These fees are applied uniformly at the protocol level.

Cryptographic signatures provide verifiable identity and authorship, making metadata, access rules, and transactions attributable and auditable without relying on centralized trust.

## Conclusion

Mojave re-architects audio distribution as shared infrastructure rather than a chain of relationships. By encoding rights, access, and delivery into a neutral protocol, it reduces costs, increases transparency, and removes long-standing operational friction.

Mojave economically scales from individual artists to enterprise catalogs while remaining open, secure, and financially predictable. This creates a solid foundation for the next generation of music platforms.
