# DDEX

[DDEX](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/) is a set of industry-standard specifications used by the global music industry to exchange metadata about recordings, releases, rights, and usage. It is also the primary metadata standard used in Mojave. Mojave uses faithful protobuf representations of the DDEX standards for all metadata operations. This is a separate project and can be found [here](https://github.com/alecsavvy/ddex-proto). The protobuf definitions are used in the internal transaction structure for the chain. This allows interoperability with other DDEX-compliant systems and allows for the creation of new DDEX-compliant systems.

## Electronic Release Notification

[Electronic Release Notification](https://kb.ddex.net/implementing-each-standard/electronic-release-notification-ern/) is the primary metadata standard used in Mojave. It is used to exchange metadata about parties, releases, recordings, and deals. Each of these entities have rules that are enforced by CometBFT consensus. 

### Header

The header of a DDEX ERN message contains vital information such as the sender, recipient, and message ID, and message thread ID. These are all required fields and the chain will reject messages that do not have all of these. The sender is the address of whoever is publishing the content. For an independent artist or distributor this could be their own identity. For a larger label or distributor this could be a derived address with signers that are authorized to publish content on their behalf.
